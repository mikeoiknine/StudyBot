And you might be one of them. But first, you'll need to complete this course. All of the guides at the MMFA have and we're confident you will, too.

For this to happen, ETL (Extract, Transform and Load) tools are a simple and scalable solution.

There are many misconceptions out there about vulnerability and its place in work environments. The truth is, it takes real strength to be vulnerable, but the payoff is huge. When we can drop all our fears, limiting beliefs and self-preservative behaviors, we show up with openness and authenticity, inspire others to do the same, and cultivate cultures of trust that continually take organizations to higher levels. Vulnerability can potentially allow dealing with difficult conversations, owning mistakes and learning from them, embracing unique strengths and talents, never worrying about what others might think or say? The possibilities vulnerability brings are endless. Sounds like a no-brainer? What if we told you there is a simple way to make all of this happen? The only thing to do to grasp the power of vulnerability is to sign up to Melissa Dawn?s online workshop. \r

\r

?	Apply strategic principles of vulnerability in the workplace that create safe spaces for supportive collaboration;\r

Data is the new gold mine. The more people interact with each other, be it through Facebook and Twitter, or platforms like Amazon, the more data is generated, collected and exploited. Unlike gold, the regulations around data are much more obscure. Does the data generated belong to those who produce them, or those who collect them? What about the ethics of using these data for commercial purposes? Some of these questions regarding the legal and ethical aspect of utilizing data have emerged given the significant commercialization of data in recent years. \r

Another angle of AI research and commercialization that must be seriously considered is the ethical use of data. Companies that spearhead AI development, such as Google and Microsoft, recognize the importance of these implications and have incorporated new ethics roles into their organizations.

    dce:description "This course proposes to engage first-year students in an epistemological conversation concerning different approaches to the conceptualization of communication and to the range of research problematics elaborated in the field and in the program. The expected outcomes include: a broad understanding of the relations between different domains within the discipline; the ability to recognize the links between epistemological assumptions, theory construction, the formation of research problematics and methodological approaches; a familiarization with the main fields of strength within the program; and the development of the ability to engage in dialogue with colleagues in different domains of research." ;

Avant-garde artists organized into numerous schools, including the Imagists, Surrealists, Dadaists, Constructivists, Futurists, and Vorticists. The literature, often produced by expatriates, was cosmopolitan, elitist, and provocative. Much of the most important work, appropriately enough in an era of female enfranchisement, was written by women. It was also the \"\"Jazz Age,\"\" the nexus of which was the Harlem Renaissance. While the course focuses on the lively cross-fertilization of British and American writing, the international scope of Modernism is also emphasized, as well as its diversity (e.g. in ballet, cinema, music, and painting).\"" ;

a preliminary project proposal, a progress and a final report (as a group); take part in\r
group discussions in audit sessions during the design phase; and participate in a poster\r
session involving individual oral presentations at the end of the winter term. In addition to\r

Op-eds are opinion pieces written on a newsworthy topic by someone that is unaffiliated with the newspaper. They enable you to bring your voice, expertise and authority on important issues to the greater public, in real-time.\r

    dce:description """Critical analysis of statistics is a crucial part of every graduate student?s professional toolkit. Statistics are used in many fields to quantify results but how they are communicated can be a source of confusion.  Knowing how to interpret numbers will allow you to evaluate academic articles and reports that you encounter in your own work.\r
\r
This workshop will seek to provide a review of basic concepts in statistics (such as mean, mode, median, variance and standard deviation) that are useful to understand, critique and communicate data. Additionally, you will learn how to carry out a simple statistical analysis to compare two groups of numerical data. The workshop will conclude with a discussion of what software or tool is most appropriate given the format or structure of your data. \r
\r
The first session of the workshop will focus on estimating different measures, and basic statistical tests. The second part of the workshop will focus on sampling techniques, reporting statistical analysis, and how to critically interpret statistics. \r

    dce:description """It may be surprising that people still fall for e-mails attempting to steal their money or identity by promising winnings to lotteries they?ve never played, international wire transfers from wealthy royalty, or an unexpected CRA tax refund. After all, similar scams have been around for over two decades; yet new variants seem to constantly pop up. This is especially true in times like these where some unscrupulous individuals take these ?old? scams and put a COVID-19 spin on them, either by promising people ?cures? or access to additional government subsidies if they only follow a given link, defrauding individuals of their money and personal information in the process. In this webinar we will review some of the most common COVID-19 scams, how to safely manage your online presence, things to consider when setting up new devices on your ?smart? home network, as well as reviewing the steps to take once you suspect being a victim of identity theft. Special thanks to Interac Corp. for supporting this webinar.\r

Students work according to a detailed job description and devote a minimum of 100 hours to the fieldwork component of the internship, keep a logbook describing their work activities, and submit a 20-25 page written report that summarizes and evaluates their work experience, positioning it in relation to broader academic questions in the field of public history. The employers participate in the assessment of the intern's work. Students may find it useful to have second-language proficiency for the purposes of this internship.\r
Prerequisite: 400-level courses are generally open to honours and specialization students, or students of high academic standing with the permission of the Department.; HIST 306.""" ;
